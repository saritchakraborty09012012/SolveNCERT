From 600 BCE–300 CE, larger mahajanapadas emerged, including monarchies (rajyas) and republics (ganas/sanghas); Magadha became the most powerful and gave rise to the Mauryan Empire. Mauryan administration: king assisted by a council of ministers (Saptanga — king, ministers, territory, forts, treasury, army, allies); provinces under governors, districts under pradeshikas, villages under gramikas. Gupta period retained the Mauryan pattern; new posts like sandhivigrahika (minister of peace and war) were added, and kumaramatyas administered at the local level. From 300–800 CE, power decentralised: kingdoms were divided into bhuktis/mandalas, vishaya/kottams, with villages as the smallest, largely self-governing unit. Later Cholas had an efficient system of mandalams, valanadus, nadus and urs, with autonomous village assemblies (variyams).',

Assemblies — sabha, samiti, vidhata — involved the community in political matters. Varna was functional, not fixed by birth; occupations were flexible and mobile. Women participated in learning, rituals, chariot races and gatherings such as the sabha. Life organised around the four ashramas and the shodasha samskaras (sixteen rites of passage). b. Early education system (gurukula): Education was holistic, cultivating truth, humility, self-control and reverence for all beings. Subjects included the Vedas, grammar, logic, philosophy, mathematics, medicine, astronomy, and arts like music, dance and archery. The guru-shishya parampara (teacher-student relationship) was sacred; the student lived as part of the teacher\'s family. Prominent centres of learning included Takshashila, Nalanda, Vikramashila and Vallabhi. c. Trade and guilds in early India: Guilds (shrenis) were associations of traders, artisans and merchants that regulated quality and prices. They functioned as banks, financiers and trustees, as seen in the Nasik cave inscription. Major trade routes — Dakshinapatha and Uttarapatha — and ports like Muziris and Tamralipti connected India to distant regions. The Jataka literature mentions eighteen types of guilds, showing their well-established role in the economy. d. Role of women in early Indian society: Vedic period: women sages (Apala, Vishvavara, Ghosha, Lopamudra) composed hymns; women attended the sabha and took part in chariot races. Post-Vedic texts like the Manu-smriti continued to emphasise honouring women. Gupta-Vakataka period: Prabhavati Gupta ruled as regent in the Vakataka kingdom and issued land grants in her own name.

The gap between C and F represents excess demand (a shortage) at that price.

- Diminishing marginal utility; substitute vs complementary goods
- Government intervention: price ceilings, price floors (MSP), monopoly regulation, public goods
- Demand and supply curves; equilibrium price and quantity calculations (e.g., Qd=Qs at 15 kg)
